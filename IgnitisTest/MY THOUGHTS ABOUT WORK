This was my biggest application project as a junior. programmer,
I stumbled across a job I was preparing for, but never got around to it because I thought 
I wasn't ready yet.
During my work, 
I really improved my software skills, learned a lot of new things and understood why a programmer needs to know OOP and collections well
