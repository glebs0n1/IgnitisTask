This was my biggest project as a junior programmer,
I stumbled across a job I was preparing for tasks like this, but never got around to it because I thought 
I wasn't ready yet. 
During my work of this task, 
I really improved my software skills, learned a lot of new things and understood why a programmer needs to know OOP and collections well
